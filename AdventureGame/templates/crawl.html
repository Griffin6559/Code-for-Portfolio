    <p>You crawl through the tunnel, it is tight, but just wide enough to move along. After a long time of moving, you find yourself at a dead end, no, the back of a painting. <br>
   You push the painting off the wall and walk out into a large room with a pair of chairs to your left. A purple carpet runs the length of the rectangular room, up the steps to the chairs. The thrones. <br>
This isn't just the castle of some noble, this is a throne room, a palace for royalty.</p>
